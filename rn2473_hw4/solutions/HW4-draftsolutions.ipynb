    "# Homework 4: Sequence to Sequence Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this homework is to familiarize you with sequence-to-sequence language modeling, specifically using an encoder-decoder model. This is the coding portion; you also have a written portion. The written portion can be found the homework instructions, i.e. the pdf you download from the syllabus website. In this notebook, you are provided with pre-written code for a simple sequence-to-sequence model that already works and learns how to reverse short sequences of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this whole jupyter notebook, it will learn to reverse short sequences of numbers. Although much of this code you will not be modifying, we recommend reading through it to get a sense of how the model and training works.\n",
    "\n",
    "This starter code is based on [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html) by Sean Robertson from the PyTorch website. It has been modified by Katy Ilonka Gero for COMS W4705 taught at Columbia University by Professor Kathy McKeown. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. modify this code to run with the E2E restaurant data set (provided)\n",
    "2. train a model on this dataset on a GPU\n",
    "3. implement beam search for evaluation\n",
    "4. implement a BLEU evaluator and report BLEU scores\n",
    "\n",
    "These do not need to be done in this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This jupyter notebook, with your solutions to the above assignments. (Note cells that require specific outputs. Do not clear outputs before submitting.)\n",
    "2. A saved model (encoder and decoder) that takes in a meaning representation and generates a restaurant description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write all your code **in this jupyter notebook**. Cells are provided where you should be implementing your code. See homework instructions for further details on how to submit this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Modify to work with E2E Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working with the end-to-end (E2E) challenge dataset. More information can be found on [their website](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/E2E/). In this dataset, the inputs are restaurant meaning representations, which are a series of key-value pairs that encode information about a restaurant. The outputs are fluent sentences that describe the restaurant. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Input: Meaning Representation*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name[The Eagle],\n",
    "eatType[coffee shop],\n",
    "food[French],\n",
    "priceRange[moderate],\n",
    "customerRating[3/5],\n",
    "area[riverside],\n",
    "kidsFriendly[yes],\n",
    "near[Burger King]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Output: Fluent Sentence*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The three star coffee shop, The Eagle, gives families a mid-priced dining experience featuring a variety of wines and cheeses. Find The Eagle near Burger King.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to read in and process the training and development data. This data is provided in csv format. Here is an example line from the `trainset.csv` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"name[Browns Cambridge], eatType[coffee shop], food[English], customer rating[5 out of 5], area[riverside], familyFriendly[no], near[Crowne Plaza Hotel]\",\"Browns Cambridge, a 5 out of 5 English coffee shop, is not kid friendly. It is located near Crowne Plaza Hotel and riverside.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to tokenize the input and output. The input should be tokenized such that each token is a single entry from the meaning representation. You can decide how to tokenize the output. Here is how the input should be tokenize, and a simple tokenization for the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Input:*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['name[Browns Cambridge]', 'eatType[coffee shop]', 'food[English]', 'customer rating[5 out of 5]', 'area[riverside]', 'familyFriendly[no]', 'near[Crowne Plaza Hotel]']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Output:*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['<SOS>', 'Browns', 'Cambridge,', 'a', '5', 'out', 'of', '5', 'English', 'coffee', 'shop,', 'is', 'not', 'kid', 'friendly.', 'It', 'is', 'located', 'near', 'Crowne', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'and', 'riverside.', '<EOS>']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to note the `<SOS>` (start-of-sequence) and `<EOS>` (end-of-sequence) tokens in the output. This is important and necessary! The decoder requires start and end tokens; the start token gives it an initial input to start generating, and the end token lets you know when to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first goal is to load in this data with [torchtext](https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a library used to manage text datasets in pytorch. *You do not need to change anything in the model or training or evaluation.* All you need to do is load in the data similar to how the number-reversal data is loaded in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Train a model on this data\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a model on this data in a reasonable period of time, you will need to run this notebook on the Google Cloud VM with a GPU. [This tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/running-jupyter-notebook-in-google-cloud-platform-in-15-min-61e16da34d52) gives a good explanation of how to use jupyter notebooks from a Google Cloud VM. It can take time to correctly get set up on a GPU, so don't leave this to the last minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we *do* recommend testing your code by loading in a small amount of data (say, 5 examples,) and training on these. This should train quickly even without a GPU and the model should be able to almost memorize the data. This is generally good practice with generative networks -- ensure your model will memorize a small amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the full e2e dataset on a GPU, it should take around 20 minutes to train a single epoch. You should see decent results after a single epoch. Decent results are sentences with a few mistakes, but are mostly readable. You are encouraged to see what kind of improvements can be found with more training or different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to modify any code to train the model, nor are you allowed to modify the model. You may modify the `trainIters` function, if you would like to improve how you track progress, or change parameters while training. For example, it can be useful to decrease the teacher-forcing ratio as training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You must submit a trained model. This model must be a GPU model. It is not reasonable to train this model with a CPU; part of the assignment is training it on a GPU.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that the model is trained using single examples -- that is, it doesn't use batching. Batching is possible with seq2seq models, but for simplicity of reading the code we have not implemented it here.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Implement a beam search evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide you with an evaluation function that takes in an input sequence and generates an output sentence given a trained model. This evaluation function performs *greedy decoding* by taking the most likely token at each generation step. You are required to implement a beam search version of this evaluation function, that keeps track of the top *k* most likely sequences at each generation step, and then returns the top *k* best sequences with their associated probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Implement a BLEU evaluator and report scores\n",
    "\n",
    "While loss and accuracy are good for tracking training progress, they don't tell us much about how well the model generates meaningful sentences. You need to implement a BLEU evaluation function that takes in an input/output pair and returns the BLEU score for how well the model predicts the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a formal description of how to calculate BLEU in the original paper, [BLEU: A Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P02-1040.pdf). We reprodue this formal description for you in the homework instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reporting these scores, use the *development dataset* provided. Report scores for greedy decoding and beam search (beam size=3). For beam search, use the top-scoring output sentence as the score for that datapoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You must implement your BLEU evaluator from scratch.* There exist python libraries that implement BLEU for you. Do not use these.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't forget the written portion!\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of open-ended questions about these tasks are required for the written portion of this homework. Please see the homework instructions for this, as well as instructions about how to submit."
