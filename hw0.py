"""Build a sentiment analysis / polarity model

Sentiment analysis can be casted as a binary text classification problem,
that is fitting a linear classifier on features extracted from the text
of the user messages so as to guess wether the opinion of the author is
positive or negative.

In this examples we will use a movie review dataset.
